* Apply the difference in differences methodology to analyze data from field experiments
* Explain why advertising context matters online 
* Discuss an approach to measure the value of advertising context

# Measuring Advertising Response

`r icons:::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("bullseye", style = "solid"), scale = 1)`
**The goal of any marketing campaign is to increase sales** 

* Either short-term or long-term

`r icons:::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid"), scale = 1)`
**How to evaluate the performance of marketing?**

Each campaign / channel is evaluated on incremental profit that it produces relative to its cost 

$$
ROI = \frac{\text{incremental profit due to advertising} - \text{cost of advertising}}{\text{cost of advertising}}
$$

Outcomes we care about today:

* Correlates of incremental profit*

# What are Display Ads?

> A type of paid online advertising, display media consists of text, image, video, audio, and motion ads, which display on websites, apps, and social media platforms. These ads can appear in several sizes, including banner and reach users across the web.

"Measuring the online sales impact of an online ad or a paid-search campaign—in which a company pays to have its link appear at the top of a page of search results—is straightforward: We determine who has viewed the ad, then compare online purchases made by those who have and those who have not seen it."

# What Ad to Show Instead? 

<br>

Two alternative sequences of ads have been studied:

1. **Public Service Ads**
  * Replace firm's ads with ads for NGO or charity
2. The **"second best" ad** in the auction
  * Called "**Ghost Ads**" in the literature

We'll talk through each methodology

# Public Service Ads Experiment

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/psa_main_idea.png")
```

Randomised Control Trial (i.e. an Experiment) 

* Users are split into two groups: 
  * **Control condition**
      * Users sees public service announcement ads - ads that help raise social awareness
  * **Treatment** (aka Test) **condition** 
      * Users see the company's ad as usual

---
class: font120
# Public Service Ads Experiment

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/psa_main_idea.png")
```

**Main idea:** 

By serving these real, alternative ads, we obtain the information on which users would have been exposed to the company's ad if the experiment did not allocate them to see PSA ads.


**Remark**:

To show the PSA alternative, you have to win the auction and choose to serve a different ad!

**Ghost Ads**: Identify ads among control group that *would have been* treatment ads *if* user was in treatment group

# The DefShop Experiment 

Motivation:  

> "We're a family business ... we’re naturally forced to double-check every cent we invest. For us it's about ... being as profitable as possible."

In the Ad marketplace: 

> "going from having only a feeling of what our ads might be driving to actually knowing their direct impact. And knowing is a much better feeling!"

Experiment Duration: 3 weeks

**Outcomes**:

* **Site Visits**: increase by 23%
* **Brand Search Queries**: increase by 38%

---
class: font160
# Takeaways 

<br>

* Measuring display ad effectiveness is difficult

* Two experimental paradigms to measure casual effects:
  * Public Service Ads (PSAs)
  * Ghost Ads 

* Ghost Ads overcome the shortcomings from PSAs

---
class: font160
# Prevailing Thoughts 

Prior to this paper ... 

* Emphasis on **user targeting**
  - Advertiser should only care about who sees the ad and not where they see it

* User information is what advertisers should value

* BUT, User info increasingly limited due to changing privacy regulation 

* Are there other ways to target ads to consumers? 
  - One alternative: website subdomains (e.g., www.nytimes.com/section/business)

# Studying Advertising Context Effects

<br>

How the researchers proceed: 

* Studied a policy change at a major private ad exchange

Remark: Once we move away from the "classical" experiment, how we analyze the data must change too!

# Analyzing Natural Experiments 

**Key Difference**: Treatment and Control units might differ systematically 

* i.e. average behaviour might differ

<br>

|                     | Before | After |
|---------------------|--------|-------|
| **Control Group**             | $\beta_0$      |  $\beta_0 + \beta_1$     |
| **Treatment Group**           | $\beta_0 + \beta_2$       |   $\beta_0 + \beta_2 + \beta_1 + \delta$    |

$\delta$ is the effect of the experiment 

.center[
`r icons:::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid"), scale = 1)`
**How can we recover it?**

# Estimating the Treatment Effect

|                     | Before | After | After - Before |
|---------------------|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Control Group**             | $\beta_0$      |  $\beta_0 + \beta_1$     |    $\beta_1$            |
| **Treatment Group**           | $\beta_0 + \beta_2$       |   $\beta_0 + \beta_2 + \beta_1 + \delta$    |  $\beta_1 + \delta$               |
| **Treatment - Control** | |  |    $\delta$            |

<br>

$\implies$ we can estimate the **average treatment effect**

**Assumption**: Parallel trends 

* if Treatment Group did not receive treatment, average would also have increased by $\beta_1$

$\rightarrow$ This is *crucial* and untestable*

---
class: font160 
# Estimating the Treatment Effect

<br>

|                     | Before | After | After - Before |
|---------------------|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Control Group**             | $\beta_0$      |  $\beta_0 + \beta_1$     |    $\beta_1$            |
| **Treatment Group**           | $\beta_0 + \beta_2$       |   $\beta_0 + \beta_2 + \beta_1 + \delta$    |  $\beta_1 + \delta$               |
| **Treatment - Control** | |  |    $\delta$            |

<br>

Can recover $\delta$ via a regression:

$$
\begin{align*}
y_{it} = \beta_0 &+ \beta_1 After_{t }+ \beta_2 TreatmentGroup_{i} + \\
                 &\delta \, TreatmentGroup_{i} \, \times \, After_{t} + \varepsilon_{it}
\end{align*}

# Ad Context: The Natural Experiment 

Platform: Anonymous Private Ad Exchange in EU 

* Private Ad Exchange? 
  - Sells display ad impressions at approx. 100 reputable websites
  - Buyers of ads are pre-approved

Implementation:

* **Treatment**: Buyer given information where subdomain appears
  - Starting May 2016 

* **Treatment Group**: Sites in 2016
* **Control Group**: Sites in 2015

* **Before**: January through April of a given year 
* **After**: May through December of a given year

Note: control group is an 'old version of ones-self'

# Implications for Marketers

Main Findings:

* Ad context matters to advertisers 
* They are willing to pay more for it 
* $\implies$ willing to pay for *right* placement

Intuitively: 

* Ad for makeup conveys a different message when placed in in a high-end fashion magazine versus on the business page of a newspaper 

Limitation on generalizability: Extremely niche sites

# What kind of firms gain most from digital advertising?

# Unequal Returns to Digital Advertising?

**Motivation** 

* Huge variation in the estimates of returns to advertising
* Existing work (typically) focuses on large firms 

**Specific Questions**

* Which firms are most likely to benefit from digital ads?
* Are there generalizable findings across firm attributes?

**How**

* Field Experiment at Yelp.com

**Population studied**: US Restaurants listed on Yelp

**Treatment**: Receive 'Standard' advertising package for free over 3 months

* August through October 2015

**Sample**: 18,294 restaurants, 50-50 treatment/control split

**Analysis**: Difference in Differences*

# Recap

---
class: font160
# Summary 

* Ghost Ads presents an experimental framework to study causal effects of online display ads 
  * Creates a log entry where an ad wins an auction but shows the second ad 
  * i.e. a competitor in the ad auction 
  * Which is a "better" control group than serving PSA ads 

* Online display ads are more effective when placed in contexts that better match the brand/product
  * The idea that context matters is relatively new 

* Digital ads are appear more effective for independent, and high quality firms
