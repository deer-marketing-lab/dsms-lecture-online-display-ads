# The Business Problem

**Seeking Answers to Strategic Questions:**

1. Are company X's online ads effective at increasing their KPIs?
2. Does the context where company X's advertising appear matter? 

Data Driven Approaches: 

1. Effectiveness: The Ghost Ads Methodology 
2. Context Effects: Field Experiment

# The Difficulty of Ad Effectiveness

Unprecedented granularity of data at individual level

* clicks, site visits, online purchases 

Why not compare the outcomes from one campaign to another?

Challenges: 

1. Which Ad / Sequence of Ads drove a sale?
2. Consumption patterns are quite volatile 
3. Chasing small-to-modest effect sizes

Where has progress been made? Online Display Ads 

* aka 'Banner Ads'

# Difficulty not always perceived!

> Measuring the online sales impact of an online ad or a paid-search campaign—in which a company pays to have its link appear at the top of a page of search results—is straightforward: We determine who has viewed the ad, then compare online purchases made by those who have and those who have not seen it.

# Ghost Ads Defined

Ghost Ads work as follows:

* Identify ads in control group that *would have been* treatment ads *if* user was in treatment group
* Control group user sees whatever ad platform chooses to deliver 
  - In contrast to a PSA ad
* Logs a Ghost Ad impression entry in a advertising database that notes where a treatment ad would have occured 

Analysis: Compare behaviour of users in treatment and control group

---
# Predicted Ghost Ads 

**Practical Challenge**: Ad platforms do not have complete control on what ad is displayed on a website

$\implies$ above needs refinement 

* **Predicted Ghost Ad**: predict whether an ad should be displayed 
  * Predicted Ghost Ad impression entered into a log entry flags whether ad is predicted to be shown ...
  * ... even if the ad is *not* shown to a user

---
# Ghost Ads in Practice

**Case Study**: Def Shop 

* An online platform that allows users to shop for hip-hop clothing, footwear and accessories.

# The DefShop Experiment 

Motivation:  

> "We're a family business ... we’re naturally forced to double-check every cent we invest. For us it's about ... being as profitable as possible."

In the Ad marketplace: 

> "going from having only a feeling of what our ads might be driving to actually knowing their direct impact. And knowing is a much better feeling!"

# DefShop Experiment Details 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="66%"}

```

KPIs:

* Purchases 
* Site Visits
* Brand Search Queries 

---
# DefShop Results
Experiment Duration: 3 weeks 

Users exposed to the Ad were ...

1. Purchasing more often (12%)
2. Visiting the site more often (23%)
3. Searching the brand more (38%)

# Takeaways 

* Measuring online marketing effectiveness is difficult
* Ghost Ads are an experimental frameowkr that provide the most accurate methodology to measure the effect

# Does Advertising Context Matter?

---
# Why Would Context Matter?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/ad_context_part.png")
```

- **Discussion Q**: Why might context matter?

---
# Prevailing Thoughts 

Prior to this paper ... 

* Emphasis on **user targeting**
  - Advertiser should only care about who sees the ad and not where they see it

* User information is what advertisers should value

* BUT, User info increasingly limited due to changing privacy regulation 

* Are there other ways to target ads to consumers? 
  - One alternative: website subdomains (e.g., www.nytimes.com/section/business)

---
# Studying Advertising Context Effects

How the authors proceed: 

* Studied a policy change at a major private ad exchange

policy change $\implies$ Natural Experiment 

Discusson Q: Why do they need an experiment?

---
# The Experiment 

Platform: Anonymous Private Ad Exchange in EU 

* Private Ad Exchange? 
  - Sells display ad impressions at approx. 100 reputable websites
  - Buyers of ads are pre-approved

Implementation:

* **Treatment**: Buyer given information where subdomain appears
  - Starting May 2016 

* **Treatment Group**: Sites in 2016
* **Control Group**: Sites in 2015

$\implies$ **Difference in Differences** 

Note: control group is an 'old version of ones-self' 

Discusson Q: Why not simply 2016 data, before vs after change?

# Implications for Marketers

* Ad context matters to advertisers ... 
* ... And they are willing to pay more for it 
* $\implies$ willing to pay for *right* placement

Intuitively: 

* ad for makeup conveys a different message when placed in in a high-end fashion magazine versus on the business page of a newspaper 

Limitation on generalizability: Extremely niche sites
